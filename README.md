🥧 **Demo Portfolio – how this moonpie?**
This project is one of the most enjoyable web projects I’ve always wanted to create. I designed a clean yet expressive UI with a subtle comics-inspired style.

🎯 **Goals**
Prioritize aesthetic and readability in web design.
Practice and enhance my skills in JavaScript and DOM manipulation.
Build a personal portfolio that reflects my own creative style.

⚙️ **About the Project**
Kept the design simple but charming with a light comics theme.
Implemented interactive features using JS, with hover animations and responsive layouts.
Focused on DOM control, event handling, and mobile compatibility.
Added animated favicon transitions for a small but lively detail.

🚀 **Future Plans**
In the future, I plan to develop this portfolio further by:

● Blending it with a Lo-fi & Pixel Art aesthetic,

● Turning it into an interactive, game-like experience,

● Offering a more dynamic and layered showcase of my work.

Thanks for stopping by this little moonpie corner of the web!
